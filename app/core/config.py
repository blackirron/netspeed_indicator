"""
Central place for all configuration.

Why this file exists:
- Every app you build will need API keys / secrets (Claude API key, etc).
- Hardcoding them in your code is how keys end up leaked on GitHub.
- This file reads them from environment variables (which come from a
  .env file locally, and from your host's dashboard when deployed).

You will basically NEVER need to touch this file when building new apps —
you just add new fields here if a new app needs a new secret/setting.
